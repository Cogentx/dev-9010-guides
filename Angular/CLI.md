# 90-10 Guide to Angular

## CLI - Advanced

### Linting

Check that your code is following the Angular style guide by running `ng lint`

### Testing

When you generate an Angular app using the CLI it automatically creates **.spec** test files for you. These are a great starting place for you to develop additional tests.

Run your test (based on karma config file by default) to ensure all your code is passing by running `ng test`
